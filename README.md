# TwitchTV API

https://whoistwitchtvonline.herokuapp.com/

This was one of the most challenging projects for me to date with having to do two Ajax calls and sharing data accross them. Also using the brand new Helix API which #FCC didn't request to be used as the old Kraken API is depricated and will cease to work in 2019.

Still an error on reloading the page that I need to iron out but the functionality works prior to doing this.

HTML / CSS was lacking a little bit of effort and the end products presentation is poor, I decided to move on to new projects before coming back to polish it up at a latter date. 

NOTE: Started working on version 1.1 which will remove bootstrap and implement CSS grid.
