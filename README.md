# TwitchTV API

https://whoistwitchtvonline.herokuapp.com/

This was one of the most challenging projects for me to date with having to do two Ajax calls and sharing data accross them. Also using a brand new API that wasn't part of the #FCC request as the one they wanted me to use is depricated and will cease to work in 2019.

Still an error on reloading the page that I need to iron out but the functionality works prior to doing this.

HTML / CSS was lacking a little as I ran out of time to focus too much energy on this challenge.

version 2 of this was to convert the bootstrap into CSS grid
