# TwitchTV API

https://whoistwitchtvonline.herokuapp.com/

This was one of the most challenging projects for me to date with having to do two Ajax calls and sharing data accross them. Also using the brand new Helix API which #FCC didn't request to be used as the old Kraken API is depricated and will cease to work in 2019.


Version 1.0 - HTML / CSS was lacking a little bit as I was focusing on the actual logic of the program for a long time.
Version 1.1 - When I started learning how to do CSS grids this was the perfect project to update as its bootstrap was a little clunky. 

Check out my first ever CSS Grid.
