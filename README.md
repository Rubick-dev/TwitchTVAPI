### Introduction
This app is one of the most challenging projects for me to date and was apart of the #FreeCodeCamp Front-End Certificates intermediate challenges. It asked us to use the kraken API provided by Twitch however this API was depreciated and being switched off in 2019. Therefore I decided to use the new Helix API, this increased the difficulty for me as there was limited documentation and the actual functionality architecture was different and I was required to do 2 calls with AJAX rather than just the one.

### The Code
I used:  
1. HTML5 & CSS3 (First Use of CSS Grid)   
2. JavaScript with a mix of Vanilla ES5/ES6 and jQuery for the ajax 

### Versions
1.0 - The HTML / CSS was neglected on the initial release as I was focusing on the actual logic of the program for a long time.  
1.1 - Updated the bootstrap layout to the CSS Grid system.
